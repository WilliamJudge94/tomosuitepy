Command Line Interface For TomoSuitepY
======================================

In order to make TomoSuitePY more accessible for server users. We have added a command line interface for the Basic, TomoGAN, and RIFE networks.
Some features have been limited to keep the terminal commands reaonsable for Users.


Starting
========

Before you begin you must use the conda install instructions for tomosuitepy basic.yml file. Once this is complete
and the User has activated the basic conda environment they will be able to move to the ~/tomosuitepy/tomosuitepy/cli/ folder
inside the provided package. From here users are presented with three file options to run programs from. 


basic.py
========

basic.py can be run by using the following:


.. code:: bash

    python basic.py --help
    python basic.py start-project /location/of/project/


The --help functionality allows Users to easily see all functions provided to them for reconstructing tomographic datasets from Sector 32IDC.
In order to change the imports once must add in this functionality to the basic.py script.
